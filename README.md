# Solar-e-Blinds
University Project

We designed and created a smartphone app to control the blinds from an iPhone smartphone.

It has 3 modes of operation: Manual, Automatic and Eco.

The Manual mode gives the user complete control over the Solar e-Blinds, whether it be tilt or roll. This allows the user to manually control the blinds immediately using their iPhone, without having to physically get up and tilt/roll the blinds themselves.

In Automatic mode we made use of the light sensor, able to detect outdoor light intensity, which we integrated into our project. This allows the user to predefine how the blinds will operate during the day as well as throughout the night. As a result, the blinds can change orientation automatically and give the user privacy, security and convenience when required.

The ECO mode allows the user to save on heating and cooling costs. This is done by utilizing the temperature sensor that detects the outside temperature and controls the blinds to regulate the temperature inside the house. Currently, the application is designed to roll the blinds up when the temperature is less than 25 deg C, and roll them down when the temperature is greater than 25 deg C to save on cooling costs.
